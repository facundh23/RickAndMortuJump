# Libraries and Dependencies

- Vite: Vite is a fast and lightweight build tool and development server for modern web projects. It offers near-instantaneous development server startup and quick HMR (Hot Module Replacement) updates, making it an excellent choice for React applications.

- React: As mentioned earlier, React is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- TypeScript: TypeScript adds static typing to JavaScript, making the development process more productive and the codebase more robust.
- react-icons: A library that offers a vast collection of customizable icons for React applications, making it simple to include icons in the UI.
- react-router-dom: React Router is used to handle navigation and routing in the application, enabling smooth transitions between different pages.

# Clone the Repository

To get a local copy of the application, follow these steps:

Open your terminal or command line.

Clone the repository by executing the following command:

`git clone https://github.com/facundh23/RickAndMortyJump.git`

Access the project directory:

`cd RickAndMortyJump/`

Install Dependencies
Before running the application, make sure you have Node.js installed on your system. Then, install the dependencies using npm or yarn (make sure to have yarn installed beforehand):

`npm install` 

or 

`yarn install`

# Run the Application
Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the application in local development mode with the following command:

`npm run dev`

or

`yarn dev`

This will launch the application in your browser at http://localhost:5173 || http://127.0.0.1:5173/.

# Additional Scripts

npm run build: This command compiles the TypeScript code and creates an optimized production-ready build.

npm run lint: Runs ESLint to check code formatting and detect issues in the TypeScript code.
